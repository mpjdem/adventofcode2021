# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode/2021) in R. 

R 4.1.2 was used. Run `renv::restore()` to recreate the package environment from the lockfile.

The goal was to mainly use a combination of base R and the `data.table` package. 
`data.table` 1.14.3 or higher is required (currently not yet on CRAN, so install from Github).

To run all code, source `run_all.R`.
